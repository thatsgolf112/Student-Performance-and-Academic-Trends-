# AI Impact on Student Academic Performance Analysis

This project go deep between AI tool and student performance. By using SQL to cleaning data and use Tableau for visualization.


##  Dataset Descriptions
1. **ai_dataset.csv** : Student Performance & Academic Trends Dataset from Kaggle
2. **ai_dataset.db** : Database on SQLite
3. **Analysis.sql** : Contains SQL for extrac information
4. **set_up_dp.py** : Code for set up dataset
5. **Dashboard.pmg** : PNG of Dashboard to visualize form Tableau

The analysis get from dataset:
1. **Ai_tool.csv**: Distribution of students across AI platforms.
2. **Dependency on AI.csv**: Dependency on AI and final score.
3. **Performance rank by final score.csv**: Performance categorization comparing AI vs non-AI users.
4. **Purpose of using AI and improvement.csv**: Analysis the reason for using AI and improvement rate by doing that.
5. **Student who passed and percentage.csv**: percentage of students who passed by using AI and not use AI.



## Key Insights

* **Passing Rate :** Students who using AI have passing rate of **89.04%**, slightly higher than non-AI users at **88.72%**.
* **AI Tools:** The combination of **ChatGPT + Gemini** is the most popular with **1,399 users**.
* **Impact of AI Dependency:** Students with a high dependency level (**High Dependency 8+**) get the highest average final score of **57.21**.
* **Understanding:** High-dependency users showed grasp of concepts, with an average understanding score of **5.58**.
* **Usage Purposes:** Using AI for **Exam Preparation** have the highest improvement rate at **10.83%**.


## Tool

* **SQL**: Data manipulation, cleaning, and aggregation.
* **Tableau**: Interactive dashboard creation and data visualization.
* **CSV**: Data storage and source files.

## Conclusion
From the data suggests that AI make positive impact on students performance even slightly increase improvement more than non-AI user.
